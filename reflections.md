On Search Inside Yourself and Meditation.

Both of my parents are Buddhists, so, as you can imagine, mindfulness was a regular topic of conversation at my house growing up. Despite this however, I personally never attempted a daily meditation practice. When I was young the concept of meditation seemed very strange to me, even though I saw my parents, especially my father, doing it constantly. I think this was because I had a very active mind as a child, and the idea of intentionally slowing it down didn’t align with my goals. I wanted to be thinking faster; thinking more. 

Over the last few years however, I have sensed the need for some kind of mindfulness practice in my life. I wouldn’t have always described it in those terms exactly, but it definitely felt like I had too many thoughts and not enough clarity or time for reflection. I read the first chapter of Search Within Yourself a week ago, and I was inspired by the idea of two minute moments of rest. <b>Meditation</b> has always intimidated me, I think partly because it is such a dominating part of my father’s life. He meditates for hours every day in the forest near his house, and when I have joined him in the past I felt in over my head. That’s why I gravitated towards this idea of fun-sized two minute meditative stints, and I’ve been finding opportunity to do them several times throughout the day.  

It wasn’t until today though, that I read chapter two of Search Inside Yourself and attempted a longer, 15 minute meditation. It was an enjoyable experience, at about 5 minutes in I noticed my breathing changing. At first it was awkward and deliberate, but then it relaxed into a slow, back-of-the-nose kind of whisper. I opened and closed my eyes at various points and was satisfied to notice that it didn’t effect my concentration adversely, I just let my eyes blur and fell back into the rhythm of breathing. Overall it was a positive experience, and I definitely left it feeling calmer than I did going in. Circumstances allowing, I plan to make it a regular part of my daily routine.  


On The Critical Inner Voice:

I personally didn’t find much to relate to in this video. While I definitely used to suffer from the evils of an overly pessimistic inner monologue, I managed (for the most part) to tame it in my later adolescence. If anything, I have experienced issues with the opposite problem; an inner voice that is unrealistically optimistic about difficult situations or scenarios. Instead of worrying about circumstantial or personal problems, the voice in my head has a tendency to downplay the importance of those things a little too much. 

For example, my wife and I had a bill at our preschool that was getting out of control. My inner voice was telling me that it was okay, “Don’t worry” he said, “You’re young parents, the preschool will understand and be lenient about the fees, you’ve got plenty of time to sort that problem out, you’re doing well”. Which, in reality, was NOT the case. True, we were not earning enough money, but the preschool is a business, and they aren’t just going to sit around and let our fees spiral out of control. Ironically it was the inner critical voice of my wife that saved the day, telling her, “Joseph clearly isn’t giving this bill the attention it warrants, the preschool is judging you and thinks you are a failure and a deadbeat”. Even though her internal monologue was exaggerating and being somewhat unfair, it was also right! We weren’t pointing enough of our financial energy at the problem, and it took a critical inner voice to diagnose that flaw.  

So, I do need to work on my critical inner voice, but maybe it’s more a matter of <b>training</b> than taming.  

On Students Learn a Powerful Lession About Privilege:

I liked the little metaphor with students throwing paper into the trash can. I think it works on many levels: 
Most notably, it fights the common myth that the only thing standing between you and success is determination. While determination is obviously a very powerful force internally, focusing on it exclusively is somewhat reductive and ignores many powerful external influences. 
Part of the metaphor I would like to see explored is the idea of success as a spectrum. If you imagine success as not simply being “I got it in the bin, or I didn’t” and instead imagine it as a continuum. i.e.: 

Ball at the end of the room == Upper class, 
Ball in the middle of the room == middle class, 
Ball at the start of the room == Working class. 

Thinking about it this way, the analogy is even more powerful, because with the same amount of effort (throwing power), somebody from the working class can make it into the middle class, as can somebody in the middle class make it into the aristocracy. Also in that vein, if you choose to not even throw your ball, and simply set it down on your desk (Not pushing for a better life, simply accepting the situation you were given) by not even trying, you may STILL end up better off than somebody who started in the working class and tried their hardest.  
Interesting stuff.
