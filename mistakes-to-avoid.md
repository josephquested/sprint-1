Top 10 Mistakes in Web Design Notes

1. Bad Search
If your website allows users to search through content, make sure the search engine terms are forgiving in favour of the user. If your search feature is overly literal, it won't be able to offer useful options if (and when) the user misspells words or uses incorrect synonyms.

2. PDF Files for Online Reading
The PDF format is great for many things, like printing or illegally distributing books. However, it is not a 
nice format to deal with in a web browser. It doesn't scale well and you can't use keyboard shortcuts to navigate it in the ways you might enjoy. There is a time and a place for PDF use, but it is not for web browsing. 

3. Not Changing the Color of Visited Links
It's like wandering into the woods and not leaving a breadcrumb trail. If you don't have a way of
judging visually where you have and have not been, your website automatically feels confusing and unenjoyable. 

4. Non-Scannable Text
Webpages generally try to present their text in an attractive and pleasantly flowing fashion. Large, inscrutable blocks of text are not enjoyable to experience on a webpage, instead try to utilise some of the following tricks: 

subheads
bulleted lists
highlighted keywords
short paragraphs
the inverted pyramid
a simple writing style, and
de-fluffed language devoid of marketese.

5. Fixed Font Size
Although as a web developer you technically have the ability to fix the font size a user experiences; don't. 
Different people have different eyes and should be allowed to resize your text accordingly.

6. Page Titles With Low Search Engine Visibility
The <title> element has many important implications on not only the page name displayed to users, but also SEO of your website or blogpost etc. The best takeaway here is this paragraph:

"Page titles are also used as the default entry in the Favorites when users bookmark a site. For your homepage, begin with the company name, followed by a brief description of the site. Don't start with words like "The" or "Welcome to" unless you want to be alphabetized under "T" or "W.""

7. Anything That Looks Like an Advertisement
Users have become to turned off by the proliferation of online advertising that they now instinctively ignore anything that looks ad-esque. I personally have found this to be very true, and have frequently missed an important component of a website because for whatever reason the designer thought they should make it flash. Never make things flash. Ever. 

8. Violating Design Conventions
Over time certain ways of doing things has evolved surrounding asthetic and functional conventions. While it might be tempting to do things your own way and craft your own experience, generally speaking doing so will be swimming upstream. If your website is an extreme functional departure from the norm, people will generally be confused, not excited.

9. Opening New Browser Windows
Not much needs to be said about this. Opening a link in a new window, (as apposed to the current window, or a new tab in the current window) is an absolute disaster. It also feels a little popup-ish, which, as noted above, we've been conditioned to despise.

10. Not Answering Users' Questions
Your users are time poor, and know what they want to know. Your goal as a website should be to give the user the information they require, efficently and clearly. This might be as simple as listing the price of your product or service front and center, along with the features and important information. Hiding important information deep in your website helps nobody.
